# Heap

A heap data structure implemented in C++ for practice and fun.

## Goals

- Brush up on C++ after years of not working with it.
- Learn what build systems/tools modern C++ code bases use.
- Learn how to unit test C++ code with a modern library (Catch2). The tests are not exhaustive; I was more concerned with getting them set up correctly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed on your system:

- g++ (version 8 or higher for C++20 support)
- CMake 3.27
- make

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the source.
    - Windows: Run `./build.bat`.
    - Mac/Linux: Run `./build.sh`.
3. To run tests, `cd build` and run `ctest`.
